This project is a dynamic web page created as part of the Java/MERN Stack Internship training. It demonstrates how to render HTML content dynamically using JavaScript based on an array of data.

The page displays a set of "People Cards" (featuring visionaries like Steve Jobs, Sundar Pichai, etc.) arranged in a responsive grid layout.

*Technologies Used
• HTML5
• CSS / Bootstrap 5 (For styling and grid layout)
• JavaScript (ES6+)

*Key Concepts & Features
This assignment focuses on the following technical concepts discussed in class:
• Data Structures: Using a JavaScript array of objects (people) to store data (Names, Roles, Images).
• Array Iteration: Utilizing the .map() function to iterate through the data and generate HTML strings.
• DOM Manipulation: Using document.getElementById to target the container and inject the generated content.
• String Interpolation: Using template literals (backticks) to insert variable data dynamically.
• Responsive Design: Using Bootstrap's col-md-4 class to create a 3-column grid layout.

*How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the index.html file in any standard web browser.
3. The cards will render automatically via the script.

*Assignment Context
• Track: Java / Web Development

• Task: Create a webpage displaying "People Cards" using specific DOM methods and Bootstrap.

• Status: Completed ✅
